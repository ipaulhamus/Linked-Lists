# Linked-Lists-C++

*What is this?* For this C++ project, I implemented both doubly and singly linked list classes utilizing generic types. The singly linked list allows for basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal, while the doubly linked list extends functionality by enabling traversal in both directions. This project highlights my ability to manipulate pointers, manage dynamic memory, and design efficient algorithms for common operations.
